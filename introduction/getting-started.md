# Getting Started

## Try It Online

You are already reading it online.

## Installation

I don't think anyone wants to download the source code of a personal website but if you really want to learn how this website is built, you can follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

- N years experience of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) development.
- N year experience of using [Git](https://git-scm.com/).
- A code editor, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- A modern web browser, such as ~~[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)~~ [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge).
- Knowledge about [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) language is recommended.

### File Structure

- The `index.md` is the homepage.
- Directories containing Markdown files are sections shown on the sidebar.
- The sidebar and navbar configurations are in `.vitepress/config.js`.

Now you are ready to build your own website.
